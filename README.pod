=head1 Hafni

Hafni is a java swing wrapper for the clojure language focusing on how components change.
This means in practice that things that normally wouldn't be changed, or is 
impossible in a convenient way, now is easily changeable and hopefully in a more functional way.

=head3 Example

Consider the following example (from Hafni.swing.test/button-test2):

 (frame :content (comp-and-events (button :name "*")
                                  :act (flow (output-arr this :name) >>>
                                             (arr #(str % "*")) >>> (input-arr this :name)))
        :size 200 200 :dont_exit_on_close)

This creates a frame (a window if you so will), with a button as content, size 200x200 and which doesn't close when the frame is closed (useful when working in the repl).
It is likely that the code

 (comp-and-events (button :name "*")
                  :act (flow (output-arr this :name) >>>
                             (arr #(str % "*")) >>> (input-arr this :name)))

will look very wierd if you haven't read the wiki. That is OK, we will now in a simple (and incomplete) way walk through this code.
We first create a button with the text "*".
 
 (button :name "*")

Then, when the button is pressed, the buttons text is extracted, another "*" is added to the end of that text, and set as the current text of the button. 
 
 (flow (output-arr this :name) >>>
       (arr #(str % "*")) >>> (input-arr this :name)))

Thus, the text of the button changes in the following way:

 "*"
 "**"
 "***"
 "****"

To accomplish this, Hafni uses the datatypes I<Event> and I<Arrow> which are both explained in the wiki.
